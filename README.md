<h4 align="center">An os that is written in python and it's better than windows 👍</h4>

## Story

Soooo this is a small side project that I do just for fun when I have free time! I started it some months ago and I still develop it just for having something to do. The os is simple but colorful, fun to add your own commands and ready to use.

## Features

Get ready for...

- 😮 An interactive command line interface with a a million different colors so your eyes will return to grayscale!
- 😎 Authentication system so your password will be hashed and NOBODY will be able to login so your unencrypted files can be safe!
- 🤑 Ability to add your own commands with as little lines of code as possible.
- 😄 As little requirements as possible so you can get to the fun part quickly.
- 😁 Anddd in any way it's better than windows!

## Default Login

Whoops, forgot to mention that the default credentials are `root` and `root`.

## Development

The os will be developed as quickly as I possibly can™ (get ready for decade updates!) and I will try to add as many features as possible. Please open an issue for any issue you encounter. I am also happy to approve pull requests!

## Installation And Running (2 in 1 😱)!

If you still want to install it (what are you doing with your life? 😂) you can follow the 3 COMMAND INSTALLATION which was extremely hard to make (yeah for sure 🙄) but works!

(Please make sure you have <span style="color:lightblue">Python3.10</span> installed else your computer will catch fire, what are you doing with python2?)

(Oh also the os doesn't work with windows beause of course it wouldn't work with windows 😅)

```shell
echo "Installing pyos!!!"
git clone https://github.com/steveiliop56/PyOS
cd PyOS/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 pyos.py
```

(Yeahh maybe it's a little more than 3 but still THE BASE COMMANDS ARE 3)

## Try the awesome GUI 🤩!

My eyes couldn't handle how bad it was, soooo, I deleted it 😁!

## License

The license is a simple GNU v3 so you can play with the code as much as your heart want. I am also not responsible if you manage to fry your computer with a simple python program. Good luck explaining to the warranty what happened 😁.
